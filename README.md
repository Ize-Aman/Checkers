# Checkers Game  
This is my first-ever project in C++, developed using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library. It’s a simple Checkers game that I created as part of a group project. While the game isn't fully functional and has its flaws, it represents my first steps into the world of programming and game development.  

## Features  
- Basic Checkers board layout.  
- Piece movement (frontend).  
- Simple textures for the pieces.  

## Challenges  
As a beginner, there were several challenges I faced while working on this project:  
1. **Game Mechanics:** Implementing the rules and logic of Checkers was the hardest part for me.  
2. **Learning Raylib:** Although straightforward, it took some effort to understand how to use the library effectively.  
3. **Debugging:** Ensuring that pieces moved correctly and troubleshooting issues was time-consuming.  

## How to Run  
1. Ensure you have [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) installed on your system.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++). For example:  
   ```bash  
   g++ -o checkers main.cpp -lraylib  
   ```  
4. Run the executable:  
   ```bash  
   ./checkers  
   ```  
5. If the above command doesn't work, try running it with the following:
`ctrl + f5` or just `f5`

## Lessons Learned  
- This project taught me the importance of teamwork and perseverance.  
- It introduced me to the basics of game development and graphics programming.  
- Even though the game isn't fully functional, I am proud of taking the first step in creating something from scratch.  

## Credits  
- **Raylib:** For providing an easy-to-use library for game development.  
- My group members, who collaborated on this project and taught me the value of teamwork.  
- Special thanks to God for helping me push through the challenges and complete this project.  

## Future Plans  
I plan to revisit this project in the future when I have more experience. I’d like to Fix the game mechanics to make it fully playable.
